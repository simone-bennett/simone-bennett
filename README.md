hey, i'm Simone 🌈✨

Recovering infra nerd. Lover of dank memes. I make a lot of typos.

Previously lived in the world of Azure, Terraform, landing zones and platform engineering. Now I help build CI/CD tools that developers love using as a Staff Product Manager at [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com).

Big on non-traditional pathways into tech. I didn't take the traditional route and I care a lot about helping people from low socioeconomic backgrounds break into the industry.
